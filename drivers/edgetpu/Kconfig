	  This driver supports the Rio device.  Say Y if you want to include
	  this driver in the kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.  The module

	help
	  Say Y to have the driver handle the tracing events sent from the
	  firmware. Enable this will increase the time for setup, suggest to
	  disable this in production mode to reduce the software overhead.

	  It's fine to have this enabled even the firmware doesn't send tracing
	  events.
