 * .reg_ctrl_enable = { {PANEL_REG_ID_VDDI, 1}, {PANEL_REG_ID_VCI, 10},},
 * .reg_ctrl_post_enable = {{PANEL_REG_ID_VDDD, 1},},
 * then the "enable" process will turn on the VDDI regulator, wait 1ms,
 * then turn on the VCI regulator, then wait 10ms.
 * Later, during the "post_enable" process, it will enable the VDDD regulator,
 * and then wait an additional 1ms.
